\title{Plot Continuous-Time Hidden OUbv Model Fit}
\usage{
plot_ctHOUbv(sim, fit, type = c("increments", "level"))
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{A list containing simulated or observed data. Must include
\code{time} and either \code{dY} (increments) or \code{Y} (levels).
If present, \code{phi} is interpreted as the true latent drift.}

\item{fit}{A fitted model object containing the estimated latent drift
(\code{fit$phi}) and regime sequence
(\code{fit$MC_res$vit_base[,4]}).}

\item{type}{Character string specifying whether to plot observed
\code{"increments"} or \code{"level"} data.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Called for its side-effect of
producing a plot.
}
\description{
Visualizes observed data together with the fitted latent bounded-variation
OU drift component from a continuous-time hidden OU model. Optionally overlays
the true latent process if it is available in the simulation object.
}
\details{
The observed series (increments or levels) is shown on the left axis in black.
The fitted latent drift is overlaid on the right axis in red (solid line).
If \code{sim$phi} is present, the true latent drift is also shown on the right
axis using a red dashed line. Vertical dashed blue lines indicate inferred
regime switches.

The function uses base R graphics and overlays the latent drift on a
secondary (right-hand) axis. Legends for the latent drift are added
automatically and adapt depending on whether the true latent process
is available.
